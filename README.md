# SWEN20003: Object-Oriented Software Development Project 2

The aim of the project is to create a Frogger-replica called 'Shadow Leap'.

Based on guidelines and game mechanics described, a UML diagram was created in order to better adhere to Object Oriented Principles, and then the game was created in Eclipse, a Java IDE, using the library Slick2D.
